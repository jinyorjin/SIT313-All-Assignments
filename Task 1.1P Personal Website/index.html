    <p>In Git, a commit is a record of changes to the Git repository. It is a snapshot of the changes made to the repository at a particular point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier, a commit message, and a timestamp. In these mini-lecture videos, you will learn the basics of Git add, commit, and Git workflow, which are essential for managing source code efficiently using the Git version control system.

        These videos will cover the fundamentals of Git add, which is used to stage changes, Git commit, which is used to save changes to the Git repository, and Git workflow. You will also learn how to use Git commands to view changes and revert changes.</p>
